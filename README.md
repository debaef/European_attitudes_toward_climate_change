# European Attitudes Toward Climate Change (2016–2017) – Power BI Dashboard

## Overview
This project was born from my personal interest in **climate change and its social impact**.  
Given the relevance of this topic for Europe’s present and future, I decided to analyse how European citizens perceived climate change during the **2016–2017** period.

To frame the analysis in a realistic and policy-oriented context, I imagined myself working as a **data analyst at the European Institute for Social Policy (EISP)**, tasked with producing a dashboard to support an article on European public opinion toward climate change.

The final result is an **interactive Power BI dashboard** designed both to **communicate key insights** and to **allow users to explore the data independently**.

## Project Context
In this scenario, the European Institute for Social Policy required a dashboard that could:
- Provide an overview of European attitudes toward climate change
- Highlight the most relevant insights emerging from the data
- Allow comparisons across European countries

I was given creative freedom in the design, allowing me to focus on the variables that best captured public concern, responsibility, and energy preferences.

## Dataset
- **Dataset:** Climate Data Clean  
- **Time period:** 2016–2017  
- **Scope:** European countries  
- **Tool used:** Power BI (entire project developed in Power BI)

---

## Key Questions Explored
- What was the general opinion of Europeans on climate change?
- How worried were Europeans about climate change?
- What were public preferences regarding renewable and non-renewable energy sources?
- How did these attitudes differ between European countries?

## Key Insights

### 🌍 Levels of Concern Across Europe
The analysis shows that climate change was already perceived as a significant issue across Europe in 2016–2017.  
Southern European countries, in particular, tend to express **higher levels of concern**, likely due to their direct exposure to climate-related phenomena such as:
- Heatwaves  
- Droughts  
- Wildfires  
- Water scarcity  

These daily experiences appear to strongly influence public perception.

### Germany as a Standout Case
Germany emerges as a particularly interesting case.  
Despite not being part of Southern Europe, it shows a **high level of perceived responsibility** toward climate change.

- **Average responsibility index:** **6.59 / 10**
- **Ranking:** Second only to France

This strong sense of responsibility is likely connected to Germany’s policy framework, particularly the **Climate Action Plan 2050**, which set long-term emission reduction targets across all sectors.  
The combination of policy ambition and accountability mechanisms seems to reinforce public awareness and responsibility.

### ⚡ Energy Source Preferences
At a European level, the data reveals that citizens show **very close average preferences** between:
- Renewable energy sources  
- Non-renewable energy sources  

This suggests that, during the 2016–2017 period, Europe was in a **transitional phase**, with growing support for renewables but without a clear and uniform dominance across all countries.

## Dashboard Features
- Interactive country-level analysis
- Visualisation of concern and responsibility indices
- Comparison of energy source preferences
- Filters enabling cross-country exploration

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**
- Data modelling
- Interactive data visualisation

---

## Conclusion
Through this project, I aimed to combine **data analysis with social and policy relevance**, using data visualisation to better understand how Europeans perceive climate change.  
The dashboard highlights how **geography, lived experience, and political frameworks** shape public attitudes, and how these factors differ across countries.
